# HelixFlow Task Management

Because only *you* know how *you* think.

The app follows this design philosphy: universal design first; created for neuro-divergent thinkers from the ground up; built to support and "poka-yoke" best practices from lean product development, lean flow and Agile; understanding the psychology of task management. Key features will be extremely flexible and powerful task breakdown and aggregation (tasks are made up of tasks in a n:m relationship of unlimited heirarchical depth using graph-db - think linked-in for "stuff to do"); multi-dimensional planning (time-, interest-, value-, goal-based) and visualisation (progress (including roll-up information), relationships, timelines, dependencies); connect any external source bidirectionally (github issues & PRs, emails, calendars, notes apps, google classroom, ... Anything that has a public API, and even stuff that doesn't if you want to hack up a web-scrapper style thing) - with open-source extensibility (connectors can be created as independant git repos and published to public package repositories then imported by the user in a simple UI)
