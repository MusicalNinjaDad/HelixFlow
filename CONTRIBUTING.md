# Contributing

Feel free to raise an issue or start a discussion with any ideas. If you want to add something - the usual PR process applies. Please try to respect the feedback from the CI (linting, formatting, testing etc.). Make sure you have good meaningful tests in place. Your code will be read by people, not just machines - it's a lot easier to write code a machine understnads than code that another human can understand - most of [PEP20](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/) applies to all languages!

Don't worry too much about your personal commit style - I will squash the PR, so do what works best for you while you are coding. Do try to be nice to me as a reviewer though with a decent title and clear description.

If that sounds too much - raise a PR anyway, or a draft, @-tag me on it and start a discussion. I'm happy to help and co-author the final version.

Don't worry about changing existing code - anecdotal evidence shows that any code more than two week's old was always written by "not me" whatever git-blame says ;)

## Contributor Accessibility

If anything in the codebase could be changed to help with any accessibility needs you have - please let me know! (e.g. I need a CI to run on my fork - otherwise I get in a tangle forgetting to format, lint, test etc. every commit by hand.)

It's a small passion of mine to think about coder accessibility - so I'm interested anyway. I'd love to hear from any dyslexic coders about code layout, naming, etc ...

## Getting up to speed

1. Use the [devcontainer](https://containers.dev/). If it's missing something, please raise a dedicated PR.

If you really want a step-by-step instruction on what to install locally to work on the codebase - take a look at [the devcontainer DockerFile](.devcontainer/DockerFile) - it documents everything much better than I can here.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

I've no real plans to do anything with this other than have fun coding and solve some of my own needs. But you never know, so the licence is chosen to avoid the risk of someone else loving it, hosting it and getting rich(er) - and to leave open the chance that I may choose to do that - or allow someone else to in the future.
